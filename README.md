# Origin And Services
- **ISKCON Overview**

In 1965, Prabhupada embarked on a journey to the United States with the vision of initiating a global Hare Krishna movement. The inception of ISKCON took place in NYC in 1966 under Prabhupada's guidance. Over the next 11 years, he successfully established more than 100 centers, temples, and diverse projects.

The expansion of ISKCON extended to Bangalore in 1987, culminating in the construction of a significant temple in 1997. Presently, ISKCON boasts a network of over 100 temples worldwide.

ISKCON Bangalore is dedicated to social work and well-being, actively engaging in various initiatives. Their activities encompass pilgrimages, cow protection, food distribution, and spiritual programs, reflecting their commitment to holistic community service.

The reviews collected exhibited issues such as multiple languages, spelling errors, and duplication. Analyzing mixed and neutral classes in the reviews posed challenges during the analysis process.
